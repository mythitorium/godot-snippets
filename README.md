Godot Snippets
======

A small collection of godot-related code snippets I find useful.
Pretty sparse for now, but it'll grow as time continues.

Now formatted so anyone delusional enough to care can use them.

Some godot knowledge is expected I ain't doing everything for you.

The Code In Question:
